Using VS Code to work on this project showed me why it’s such a popular tool for coding. I like that everything is in one place — I can edit files, use the terminal, and even work with Git without leaving the program. It made building and running the Docker container easier because I could type all the commands directly inside VS Code and see the results right away. One of the best parts is the extensions. They make things like Docker, GitHub, or even just formatting code much smoother. I also like that VS Code highlights errors as I type, which helps me catch mistakes before running the program. The main challenge at first was learning how to use the integrated terminal instead of just my Mac’s terminal. Once I got used to it, I realized it saves time and keeps me more organized. Overall, working in VS Code gave me a better workflow, and I can see why developers rely on it for projects. It makes coding feel less overwhelming and more structured.
